## Description

Welcome to RoboTF's AI Suite of tools for running Large Language Models (LLM's) locally or self-hosted. This will be a collection of Docker Compose and other such resources for helping people get start running such tools as LocalAI, ComfyUI, Open WebUI, and more!

Check out the Youtube series for Build an Ubuntu AI/LLM Server from scratch here: [https://www.youtube.com/@RoboTFAI](https://www.youtube.com/@RoboTFAI)

### LocalAI with Docker Compose üñ§

Edit the `LocalAI/localai-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use. See the docs at [localai](https://localai.io)

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make localai-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make localai-down
```

**Warning LocalAI will download several models on it's first startup to handle Chat, Image Generation, etc, etc as this calls the AIO image. See more info at [localai](https://localai.io)

This calls docker-compose under the hood with the Makefile, to see more commands type

```bash
make help
```

### ComfyUI with Docker Compose üñ§

Edit the `ComfyUI/comfyui-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use. See the docs at [comfyui](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and [YanWenKun](https://github.com/YanWenKun/ComfyUI-Docker) for docs on the container.

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make comfyui-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make comfyui-down
```

**Warning ComfyUI will download several models on it's first startup to support Image Generation See more info at [YanWenKun](https://github.com/YanWenKun/ComfyUI-Docker)

This calls docker-compose under the hood with the Makefile, to see more commands type

```bash
make help
```

Visit http://<your server ip>:8188 to see the ComfyUI UI

### Open WebUI with Docker Compose üñ§

Edit the `Open-WebUI/openwebui-compose.yaml` to your liking and match the volume mount, and environment variables you want to use. See the docs at [openwebui](https://github.com/open-webui)

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make openwebui-up
```

To stop it

```bash
make openwebui-down
```

This calls docker-compose under the hood with the Makefile, to see more commands type

```bash
