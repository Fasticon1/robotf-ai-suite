## Description

Welcome to RoboTF's AI Suite of tools for running Large Language Models (LLM's) locally or self-hosted. This will be a collection of Docker Compose and other such resources for helping people get start running such tools as LocalAI, ComfyUI, and more!

## Getting Started üßπ

Set Up Docker Compose: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, then run:

```bash
make localai-up
```

**Warning LocalAI with download several models on it's first startup to handle Chat, Image Generation, etc, etc as this calls the AIO image. See more info at ![localai](https://localai.io)

This calls docker-compose under the hood with the Makefile, to see more commands type

```bash
make help
```

```bash
Usage:
  make <target>
